- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vuniverse0
- 👀 I’m interested in aps, embeded, data and games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gof.
- 💞️ I’m looking for job as prejunior-junior c++ coder 
- 📫 Mail: v.universerb@protonmail.com

P.S. Don't rate my code against old repositories. I'm too lazy to rewrite them, but I've already learned how to make the code more readable.
